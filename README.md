# ISU
Source code from ISU exercises from Aarhus University School of Engineering.

**ISU1 - Course intro and Introduction to OS and programming in C/C++ in Linux**
> A little about Makefiles and how they work. We're making a simple Makefile.

**ISU2 - Building C/C++ programs for Target**
> More advanced Makefiles, now with different targets (host/target).

**ISU3 - Posix Threads**
> Starting out with posix threads, for multithreaded programs on Linux.

**ISU4 - Thread synchronization I**
> Synchronization between threads. Multiple threads using the same variable (needs protection). Mutexes and semaphores.

**ISU5 - Thread synchronization II**
> More synchronization between threads. This time more about signalling from one thread to another.

**ISU6 - Thread communication**
> Thread communication utilized with a Message Queue event system.

**ISU7 - OS API**
> An OS API abstraction layer for all our threading, timers and more.

**ISU8 - Resource handling**
> Pointers just got easy! Smart pointers are introduced.
